We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin.

Using genetic labeling for cell-lineage tracing, we showed that the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors originate from dorsal spinal nerve roots are the cells of origin for plexiform neurofibromas. Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis. Most importantly, the ability to isolate embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1 ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neurofibromas provides a reliable and robust non-germline neurofibroma model for in vivo drug screening with a quantifiable and reproducible outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead compounds for clinical assessment. In this application, we propose to establish the utility of this non-germline plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) model as a rapid preclinical therapeutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies for pNF. To achieve this goal, we will first explore the possibility of long term storage of DNSCs to maintain their tumorigenic potential for reliable and rapid plexiform neurofibromagenesis.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a type of therapy that focuses on encouraging individuals to engage in more adaptive ways of coping with pain. The goal of ACT is not to eliminate the person's pain, but to optimize the person's functioning despite their pain. This study is examining the impact of an 8-week ACT intervention on pain interference and other variables among AYA ages 16-34 years with NF1, one or more PNs, and chronic pain. We also are exploring the role of heart rate variability (HRV), which is a physiological marker of pain, in this population. The goal of this project is to establish ACT's effectiveness as a psychological intervention tool targeting chronic pain in patients with NF1/PN, in order to improve daily functioning and pain interference. Our primary goal is to compare changes in pain interference scores from pre- to post- intervention between the ACT group and the waitlist (WL) group.

A psychometrically sound measure incorporating input from patients, families and clinicians, is critical for inclusion in treatment trials. To address the need for a pNF-specific PRO measure for use in clinical trials, this project sought to develop a PRO measurement system utilizing input from patients, families and clinicians, as well as well as psychometric analysis methods to ensure the developed measures are reliable and valid. Specifically this project designed a PRO system for children and young adults with pNF by (1) establishing a conceptual model describing HRQOL, 2) Developing item pools (e.g., pain, stigma, and organ dysfucntion measures), 3) Evaluating psychometric properties of the pools, 4) affirming clinical differences.',\n            'https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4939888/wiki/235900',\n            'Jin-Shei Lai',\n            'Northwestern University',\n            'Plexiform Neurofibroma',\n            'Neurofibromatosis 1',\n            null,\n          ],\n          versionNumber: 22,\n          rowId: 142,\n        },\n        {\n          values: [\n            'Drug Screening of pNF Cell Lines',\n            'syn4939906',\n            'syn7850572',\n            'Completed',\n            'Partially Released',\n            'NTAP',\n            'A lack of cellular model systems was identified as a major gap in pNF therapeutics-focused research when NTAP was launched in 2012.

Moreover, the tumors in these models are slow growing (requiring 9-12 months for a single compound efficacy study) and costly. Hence, there is a need for in vivo models that allow more rapid drug screening (particularly when considering possible combinatorial therapies) and a need for in vitro models that allow more facile manipulation of the NF1 gene in order to understand the molecular genomics influencing tumor behavior.

In this work, we propose to use co-cultures of cNF-derived primary SCs and FBs to identify expression signatures in cNFs that are specifically due to SC-FB heterotypic interactions. For this purpose we will compare RNA-Seq data from cNFs, their single cell primary cultures and co-cultures of SCs and FBs. Furthermore, we will identify the genetic variation present in gene coding regions of neurofibroma donors. Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally.

While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens.

Mast cells are known to be abundant in cNFs and they are increasingly more interesting as druggable targets in tumor biology and neurogenic itch. It is also not known whether mast cells of cNFs are tumorigenic or anti- tumorigenic. The goal of this project is to prove that T cells and mast cells are valid targets for the treatment of cNF.

Plexiform neurofibromas grow most aggressively in young children, and an appealing (unproven) idea is that transiently blocking growth of plexiform neurofibromas early in tumor development will prevent tumor progression. Models to study these critical issues have been lacking.
