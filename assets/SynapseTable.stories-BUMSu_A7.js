physiological system that supports the growth of cNF tumor cells is required for drug screening efforts. We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin.

Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis. Most importantly, the ability to isolate embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1 ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neurofibromas provides a reliable and robust non-germline neurofibroma model for in vivo drug screening with a quantifiable and reproducible outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead compounds for clinical assessment. In this application, we propose to establish the utility of this non-germline plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) model as a rapid preclinical therapeutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies for pNF.

Furthermore, we will identify the genetic variation present in gene coding regions of neurofibroma donors. Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally.

While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To identify these potentially clinically-actionable mitogens, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations.","Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.",'If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite study here:  Anastasaki, C., Mo, J., Chen, JK. et al.

There are few therapeutic options, and the vast majority of people with these cancers will die within 5 years of diagnosis. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of these tumors and the identification of seemingly-promising therapeutic targets using a single mouse MPNST model system (NPCis mice and derivative cell lines), no investigational agents have demonstrated efficacy following translation to human clinical trials. However, there is limited genetic diversity being modeled in these systems, which does not capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity that characterizes human NF1-MPNSTs. In this regard, p53 loss, a common feature of the currently-used preclinical models, is observed in a minority of human MPNSTs. We hypothesize that one of the major reasons that rationally-chosen drugs underperform in human clinical trials is that the preclinical models used to discover and evaluate promising therapeutic agents do not capture the genetic heterogeneity of the human cancer. To optimize clinical translation, we aim to develop a collection of MPNST Patient Derived Xenografts (MPNST-PDXs) for the NF community, which more fully represent the spectrum of genetic heterogeneity seen in the human condition. The main goal of this research project is to develop a set of NF1-MPNST PDX lines that captures the spectrum of molecular heterogeneity of the human disease. The proposal aims to meet the following objectives: a. Create enabling resources including 10 NF1-MPNST PDX lines for preclinical studies. b. Histologically and genomically characterize these 10 NF1-MPNST PDX lines, thereby defining the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors. c.

The FDA recommends including endpoints in NF1 clinical trials that assess changes in symptoms, such as pain, in addition to tumor reduction. Currently, no valid PRO measures exist that assess PN-related pain and its effect on daily functioning. The first phase of this limited-site study is to modify existing PRO pain tools using qualitative methods to ensure understanding of the concepts being assessed and to examine how the current tools work in the NF1/PN population. The second phase is to examine the psychometric properties of the modified PROs in individuals with NF1 and PNs. The goal of this project is to produce the most reliable, valid, and feasible measures of pain intensity and pain interference, as end-points in clinical trials or intervention studies.",null,"The data from this study are still under embargo, therefore, if you have been granted access by the data contributor, you must work with them to determine how to acknowledge your collaboration in any manuscripts that arise.
