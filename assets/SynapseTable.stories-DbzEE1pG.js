physiological system that supports the growth of cNF tumor cells is required for drug screening efforts. We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin. While beyond the scope of the current project, the cNF models developed and validated here may be used in the future to perform automated high throughput 3D drug screenings to identify possible new therapeutic options for NF1 patients.","Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.","Please acknowledge the NF Data Portal like so: “The results published here are in whole or in part based on data obtained from the NF Data Portal (http://www.nf.synapse.org, RRID:SCR_021683) and made available through the NF Open Science Initiative.”","syn11374354"]},{rowId:500,versionNumber:897,values:["Synodos NF2","syn2343195","Synodos for NF2 is a first-of-its-kind neurofibromatosis research collaboration dedicated to defeating the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).

Using genetic labeling for cell-lineage tracing, we showed that the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors originate from dorsal spinal nerve roots are the cells of origin for plexiform neurofibromas. Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis. Most importantly, the ability to isolate embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1 ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neurofibromas provides a reliable and robust non-germline neurofibroma model for in vivo drug screening with a quantifiable and reproducible outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead compounds for clinical assessment. In this application, we propose to establish the utility of this non-germline plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) model as a rapid preclinical therapeutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies for pNF. To achieve this goal, we will first explore the possibility of long term storage of DNSCs to maintain their tumorigenic potential for reliable and rapid plexiform neurofibromagenesis.

Specifically this project designed a PRO system for children and young adults with pNF by (1) establishing a conceptual model describing HRQOL, 2) Developing item pools (e.g., pain, stigma, and organ dysfucntion measures), 3) Evaluating psychometric properties of the pools, 4) affirming clinical differences.","Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.","The data from this study are still under embargo, therefore, if you have been granted access by the data contributor, you must work with them to determine how to acknowledge your collaboration in any manuscripts that arise.

Moreover, the tumors in these models are slow growing (requiring 9-12 months for a single compound efficacy study) and costly. Hence, there is a need for in vivo models that allow more rapid drug screening (particularly when considering possible combinatorial therapies) and a need for in vitro models that allow more facile manipulation of the NF1 gene in order to understand the molecular genomics influencing tumor behavior.

In this work, we propose to use co-cultures of cNF-derived primary SCs and FBs to identify expression signatures in cNFs that are specifically due to SC-FB heterotypic interactions. For this purpose we will compare RNA-Seq data from cNFs, their single cell primary cultures and co-cultures of SCs and FBs. Furthermore, we will identify the genetic variation present in gene coding regions of neurofibroma donors. Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally.

While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To identify these potentially clinically-actionable mitogens, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations.","Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.",'If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite study here:  Anastasaki, C., Mo, J., Chen, JK. et al.

But how these cells and the intercellular communications contribute to plexiform neurofibroma growth is unknown. It has been recently identified that macrophage is a major cell type in neurofibromas. Macrophages shift gene expression and function in response to the environment, including after nerve injury. Macrophages show anti- tumor effects by secreting free-radicals and recruiting the adaptive immune system (primarily T-cells). However as tumors progress, macrophages stimulate tumor growth and blood vessel formation. Injury-associated inflammation facilitates neurofibroma development by recruiting macrophages in mouse models. How these inter- and intra-cellular interactions contribute to neurofibroma formation has not been studied yet. The goals of this project are to characterize gene expression profiles of Schwann cells and macrophages in mouse nerves and neurofibromas, identify cytokine/chemokine pathways that slow or promote tumor growth and identify molecular networks that mediate intra- and inter-cellular signaling in controlling neurofibroma growth.","Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.",'If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite the following publication: "Choi K, Komurov K, Fletcher JS, Jousma E, Cancelas JA, Wu J, Ratner N.

There are few therapeutic options, and the vast majority of people with these cancers will die within 5 years of diagnosis. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of these tumors and the identification of seemingly-promising therapeutic targets using a single mouse MPNST model system (NPCis mice and derivative cell lines), no investigational agents have demonstrated efficacy following translation to human clinical trials. However, there is limited genetic diversity being modeled in these systems, which does not capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity that characterizes human NF1-MPNSTs. In this regard, p53 loss, a common feature of the currently-used preclinical models, is observed in a minority of human MPNSTs. We hypothesize that one of the major reasons that rationally-chosen drugs underperform in human clinical trials is that the preclinical models used to discover and evaluate promising therapeutic agents do not capture the genetic heterogeneity of the human cancer. To optimize clinical translation, we aim to develop a collection of MPNST Patient Derived Xenografts (MPNST-PDXs) for the NF community, which more fully represent the spectrum of genetic heterogeneity seen in the human condition.

To address these challenges, we developed an application that enables exploration of the chemical-biological interaction space. Drug-target interaction data from ChEMBL (CC BY-SA 3.0), ChemicalProbes.org (CC BY-SA 3.0), DGIdb (open), DrugBank (CC BY-NC 4.0, used with approval), and Klaeger, et al, 2017 was collected for over 280,000 molecules. In addition, when quantitative data were obtained, pChEMBL values were calculated. Each molecule was annotated with a name and chemical structure, and every target was annotated with protein & gene identifiers. An interactive web interface was developed using the R Shiny platform and cheminformatics R packages.","Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.",'If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite the following publication: "Allaway RJ, La Rosa S, Guinney J, Gosline SJC.

The FDA recommends including endpoints in NF1 clinical trials that assess changes in symptoms, such as pain, in addition to tumor reduction. Currently, no valid PRO measures exist that assess PN-related pain and its effect on daily functioning. The first phase of this limited-site study is to modify existing PRO pain tools using qualitative methods to ensure understanding of the concepts being assessed and to examine how the current tools work in the NF1/PN population. The second phase is to examine the psychometric properties of the modified PROs in individuals with NF1 and PNs.
