Our findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and derivative data will be shared on Synapse.

To investigate antimatter, we will be performing spectrometry on samples of Xen crystals. We will be using an anti-mass spectrometer to analyze the samples' properties. We will also be using a Lambda Core to generate the necessary energy for the spectrometry. The data generated will be used to determine the properties of the antimatter, and to determine if it can be used as a power source.`};String(e.id);export{t as M,i as a};
