a physiological system that supports the growth of cNF tumor cells is required for drug screening efforts. We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin. While beyond the scope of the current project, the cNF models developed and validated here may be used in the future to perform automated high throughput 3D drug screenings to identify possible new therapeutic options for NF1 patients.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11374354/wiki/488832","Alice Soragni","University of California, Los Angeles","Cutaneous Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1",null],versionNumber:27,rowId:131},{values:["Synodos NF2","syn2343195","syn11614200","Completed","Partially Released","CTF","Synodos for NF2 is a first-of-its-kind neurofibromatosis research collaboration dedicated to defeating the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).

Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis.

Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally. The goal of this study is to understand the signaling between SCs and FBs within cNFs and their importance and impact on their viability, proliferation capacity and contribution to cNF development.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11374353/wiki/488830","Eduard Serra","IGPT","Cutaneous Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1",null],versionNumber:22,rowId:144},{values:["Genetic Studies of Neurofibromas","syn11374339","syn11601459","Active","Under Embargo","NTAP","NF1 cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) have some similarities to non-cutaneous (plexiform) neurofibromas, but there are also differences whose molecular bases are not well characterized.

Collins Scholarship examines two innovative and non-invasive measures of tissue microstructure: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance technique to quantify white matter tracts and assess tract damage by measuring the preferential motion of water molecules along and not across hydrophobic myelin. In preliminary data, measures of white matter integrity in the optic radiations of children with OPG are associated with current visual acuity and may predict visual acuity one year later. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) uses pseudo-randomized magnetic resonance acquisition parameters and a matching algorithm to rapidly quantify T1, T2, M0 and off-resonance signals. These measures of tissue microstructure have been associated with identification of tissue type and tumor grade, but have never before been available so rapidly and reliably.

While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To identify these potentially clinically-actionable mitogens, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11374345/wiki/488824","David Gutmann","Washington University of Saint Louis","Cutaneous Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1",null],versionNumber:22,rowId:148},{values:["Microenvironmental Targets of Cutaneous Neurofibromas","syn11374341","syn11601468","Active","Under Embargo","NTAP","Immunity has a central and complex role in tumor growth, which can be utilized when developing new treatment modalities for tumors. To date, the role of immune system in cNFs has gained little attention. Transformed cells are normally eradicated by cooperation of innate and adaptive immune cells. Immune surveillance could be expected to recognize neurofibromin neoepitopes resulting from the second hit of the NF1 gene, but this is not taking place in cNFs. Mast cells are known to be abundant in cNFs and they are increasingly more interesting as druggable targets in tumor biology and neurogenic itch. It is also not known whether mast cells of cNFs are tumorigenic or anti- tumorigenic. The goal of this project is to prove that T cells and mast cells are valid targets for the treatment of cNF. Elucidating the characteristics, roles and effects of these prominent tumor microenvironment components in promoting tumorigenesis could be used to facilitate finding of targeted therapies for the treatment of cNF.

Transcriptome profiling of cell lines will complement these data sets, together providing a detailed view of the cellular signaling networks and the molecular targets controlled by neurofibromin in a cell-type relevant to the disease. Finally, we will use small molecule inhibitors to both known and any novel signaling pathways we identify to examine the adaptive kinome in treated cell lines.

Most plexiform neurofibromas are resistant to chemotherapy and surgical removal is often impossible due to tumor size, location, and nerve integration. We jo not know why some human neurofibromas grow slowly and some rapidly, nor why some neurofibromas respond to therapy but others do not. Plexiform neurofibromas grow most aggressively in young children, and an appealing (unproven) idea is that transiently blocking growth of plexiform neurofibromas early in tumor development will prevent tumor progression. Models to study these critical issues have been lacking. Our laboratory has recently developed mouse models that recapitulate 1) slow and fast growing neurofibromas, and 2) neurofibromas that respond or fail to respond to targeted molecular therapy. We plan to use new methods in gene expression analysis to identify molecular pathways that correlate with these phenotypes in mouse models, with verification on human tissues. We also plan test if early treatment delays or halts neurofibroma formation by administering drugs before tumors develop in a neurofibroma mouse model.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4939892/wiki/235902","Nancy Ratner","Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center","Plexiform Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1",null],versionNumber:33,rowId:151},{values:["NF1 Dermal Neurofibroma Longitudinal Natural History Study and Selumetinib Clinical Trial","syn8012530","syn11678417","Active","Under Embargo","NTAP","Previous reports have correlated increased burden of dermal neurofibromas (DNs) with age and pregnancy, but longitudinal data are not available to establish a quantitative natural history of these tumors.
