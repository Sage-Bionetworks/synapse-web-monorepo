            "Given the absence of therapeutic options and the heterogeneous nature of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF), a physiological system that supports the growth of cNF tumor cells is required for drug screening efforts. We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin. While beyond the scope of the current project, the cNF models developed and validated here may be used in the future to perform automated high throughput 3D drug screenings to identify possible new therapeutic options for NF1 patients.",

            "We utilized a genetically engineered mouse model as a tool to identify the cell of origin for plexiform neurofibroma. Using genetic labeling for cell-lineage tracing, we showed that the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors originate from dorsal spinal nerve roots are the cells of origin for plexiform neurofibromas. Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis. Most importantly, the ability to isolate embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1 ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neurofibromas provides a reliable and robust non-germline neurofibroma model for in vivo drug screening with a quantifiable and reproducible outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead compounds for clinical assessment. In this application, we propose to establish the utility of this non-germline plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) model as a rapid preclinical therapeutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies for pNF. To achieve this goal, we will first explore the possibility of long term storage of DNSCs to maintain their tumorigenic potential for reliable and rapid plexiform neurofibromagenesis. Next, we will develop it into a robust plexiform neurofibroma model for preclinical drug screening by testing therapeutic effects of different pharmacological interventions.",

            "NF1-related pain is often not well-controlled with medication and many of the medications cause significant side effects. To our knowledge, only one prior study (by our group) has examined the effectiveness of a psychological intervention for chronic pain in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with NF1 and PNs. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a type of therapy that focuses on encouraging individuals to engage in more adaptive ways of coping with pain. The goal of ACT is not to eliminate the person's pain, but to optimize the person's functioning despite their pain. This study is examining the impact of an 8-week ACT intervention on pain interference and other variables among AYA ages 16-34 years with NF1, one or more PNs, and chronic pain. We also are exploring the role of heart rate variability (HRV), which is a physiological marker of pain, in this population. The goal of this project is to establish ACT's effectiveness as a psychological intervention tool targeting chronic pain in patients with NF1/PN, in order to improve daily functioning and pain interference. Our primary goal is to compare changes in pain interference scores from pre- to post- intervention between the ACT group and the waitlist (WL) group. Secondary aims include examining baseline to post-treatment changes in quality of life, pain severity, depression, pain-related anxiety, and HRV, assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG); comparing the ACT and WL groups on pre-post changes in quality of life, pain intensity, depression, pain-related anxiety, and HRV; and examining the relationships of HRV with pain and psychosocial variables.",

Our overall project will advance via two parallel but interwoven efforts: (1) Characterize cNF cell of origin to trace their developmental origin as well as to define their phenotypes and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. This will provide a framework for elucidating the functional contributions of cNF cell of origin in neurofibroma development. (2) To determine biological steps that are critical for cNF development.

We will do this by first deconstructing human cNFs through single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-Seq) to rigorously define the cell populations and sub-populations in these complex tumors. We will then develop three-dimensional (3D) co-culture models of these tumors as a step toward pathomimetic systems for more accurate preclinical therapeutic screening.The goal of the first aim is to use scRNA-Seq to develop an unbiased portrait of the cellular composition of NF1 cNFs. Each tumor that is deconstructed will be a milestone along the way to reaching that goal. We anticipate that at least 8 tumors will need to be deconstructed to take account of the high degree of heterogeneity in the these tumors. Approximately 10,000 cells from each sample will be subject to scRNA-Seq, with the rest used for development of primary cNF cells and fibroblasts for use in Aim Two. The second aim has the goal of development of pathomimetic avatars of NF1 cNFs that will be useful for therapeutic testing. The number and complexity of the avatars required will be determined by the results of the scRNA-Seq. Milestones will be successful development of 3D culture and co-culture conditions for the cell types and of quantitative assays for their morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis.",

While current animal models can faithfully mimic some aspects of pNF (tumor histology, imaging characteristics, natural history), they are based on relatively narrow genetically engineered platforms and are not fully representative of human NF1 diversity. Moreover, the tumors in these models are slow growing (requiring 9-12 months for a single compound efficacy study) and costly. Hence, there is a need for in vivo models that allow more rapid drug screening (particularly when considering possible combinatorial therapies) and a need for in vitro models that allow more facile manipulation of the NF1 gene in order to understand the molecular genomics influencing tumor behavior. The goal of this project is to create a panel of cell culture systems that represent pNF complexity and can be utilized to both screen new compounds as well as to identify new therapeutic targets.",

            "Inactivation of the NF1 gene in SCs is believed to be the cause triggering cNF formation. Extensive analysis has shown that from a genetic and genomic perspective, there is no additional recurrent genetic alteration besides the NF1 inactivation involved in cNFs. Despite its simple genetic etiology, the contribution of the interactions among cells composing cNFs need to be investigated to better understand their role in cNF formation and their potential influence on treatment response. In this work, we propose to use co-cultures of cNF-derived primary SCs and FBs to identify expression signatures in cNFs that are specifically due to SC-FB heterotypic interactions. For this purpose we will compare RNA-Seq data from cNFs, their single cell primary cultures and co-cultures of SCs and FBs. Furthermore, we will identify the genetic variation present in gene coding regions of neurofibroma donors. Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally. The goal of this study is to understand the signaling between SCs and FBs within cNFs and their importance and impact on their viability, proliferation capacity and contribution to cNF development.",

Non-invasive methods of investigating white matter tract integrity and tissue microstructure may help measure and predict visual acuity in children with OPG. Research supported by the Francis S. Collins Scholarship examines two innovative and non-invasive measures of tissue microstructure: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance technique to quantify white matter tracts and assess tract damage by measuring the preferential motion of water molecules along and not across hydrophobic myelin. In preliminary data, measures of white matter integrity in the optic radiations of children with OPG are associated with current visual acuity and may predict visual acuity one year later. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) uses pseudo-randomized magnetic resonance acquisition parameters and a matching algorithm to rapidly quantify T1, T2, M0 and off-resonance signals. These measures of tissue microstructure have been associated with identification of tissue type and tumor grade, but have never before been available so rapidly and reliably. The goal of this project is to interrogate 2 two promising advanced magnetic resonance techniques, DTI and MRF, investigating tissue microstructure in OPG.",

            "Cutaneous or dermal neurofibromas (cNFs) are composed of neoplastic Schwann cells embedded in a microenvironment containing terminal nerve endings, fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages. While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To identify these potentially clinically-actionable mitogens, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations.",

To date, the role of immune system in cNFs has gained little attention. Transformed cells are normally eradicated by cooperation of innate and adaptive immune cells. Immune surveillance could be expected to recognize neurofibromin neoepitopes resulting from the second hit of the NF1 gene, but this is not taking place in cNFs. Mast cells are known to be abundant in cNFs and they are increasingly more interesting as druggable targets in tumor biology and neurogenic itch. It is also not known whether mast cells of cNFs are tumorigenic or anti- tumorigenic. The goal of this project is to prove that T cells and mast cells are valid targets for the treatment of cNF. Elucidating the characteristics, roles and effects of these prominent tumor microenvironment components in promoting tumorigenesis could be used to facilitate finding of targeted therapies for the treatment of cNF. The therapeutic modalities include those already approved and those being developed for tumor biology as well as for inflammatory diseases.",

Recent advances in mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics permit the determination of the extent, localization, and site-specific stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation. We propose using two complementary MS-based approaches to define (i) the proteome and phosphoproteome and (ii) the activated kinome signature of NF1-deficient Schwann cells (SCs). We will perform analyses on a panel of SC lines derived from PNs. Transcriptome profiling of cell lines will complement these data sets, together providing a detailed view of the cellular signaling networks and the molecular targets controlled by neurofibromin in a cell-type relevant to the disease. Finally, we will use small molecule inhibitors to both known and any novel signaling pathways we identify to examine the adaptive kinome in treated cell lines. Combining the use of a novel panel of cell lines with the sensitivity of high-end MS, we expect to identify signaling pathways and targets previously implicated as being important in NF1-associated tumors, as well as new and unexpected targets downstream of NF1.",

Most plexiform neurofibromas are resistant to chemotherapy and surgical removal is often impossible due to tumor size, location, and nerve integration. We jo not know why some human neurofibromas grow slowly and some rapidly, nor why some neurofibromas respond to therapy but others do not. Plexiform neurofibromas grow most aggressively in young children, and an appealing (unproven) idea is that transiently blocking growth of plexiform neurofibromas early in tumor development will prevent tumor progression. Models to study these critical issues have been lacking. Our laboratory has recently developed mouse models that recapitulate 1) slow and fast growing neurofibromas, and 2) neurofibromas that respond or fail to respond to targeted molecular therapy. We plan to use new methods in gene expression analysis to identify molecular pathways that correlate with these phenotypes in mouse models, with verification on human tissues. We also plan test if early treatment delays or halts neurofibroma formation by administering drugs before tumors develop in a neurofibroma mouse model.",

Moreover, the genomic mechanisms responsible for dermal tumor proliferation are not completely understood, although biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene is known to be required. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, which negatively regulates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade that includes the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pro-growth pathways. Current therapeutic development for NF1-related tumors target components of this pathway; however, clinical trials directed at dermal neurofibromas have been hampered by the difficulty in measuring and counting dermal neurofibromas. The overall goal of this project is to complete a longitudinal natural history study of dermal neurofibromas to enhance current knowledge of dermal neurofibroma development as well as improve the design, implementation, and interpretation of clinical trials targeting DNs. To address the clinical trial facet of this project, a trial using the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib will be piloted.
