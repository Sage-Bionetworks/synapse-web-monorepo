No other \n application should prompt a user for their user name and password.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n Synapse allows authentication via a white listed OAuth 2.0 provider.  Currently only Google is supported.\n The final step is ,<a href=\"${POST.oauth2.session2}\">,POST /oauth2/session2,</a>, which returns an access token\n which is included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of \n subsequent requests as described above.  Only Synapse itself may use this service, as redirection back\n from the OAuth2 provider is only allowed to the Synapse web portal.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n A registered OAuth 2.0 client can use the ,<a href=\"#org.sagebionetworks.auth.controller.OpenIDConnectController\">,OAuth 2.0 services,</a>,\n to authenticate, the final step of which is a request to the token endpoint:\n ,<a href=\"${POST.oauth2.token}\">,POST /oauth2/token,</a>,\n The returned access token is included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of \n subsequent requests as described above.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n A user may freely generate up to 100 Personal access tokens (PATs) with scoped access using \n ,<a href=\"${POST.personalAccessToken}\">,POST /personalAccessToken,</a>,. Unlike OAuth access tokens,\n ,<ul>,\n     ,<li>,PATs can be freely generated by a user alone and are not linked to any third party OAuth client and,</li>,\n     ,<li>,While ATs have a strict 24 hour lifetime, PATs are long lived, and will only expire if unused for 180 consecutive days,</li>,\n ,</ul>,\n For these reasons, it is critical to treat PATs as sensitive credentials, like passwords. If a user creates more than 100 tokens, then\n the least-recently used token(s) will be deleted until the user has no more than 100 tokens.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n The returned personal access token is included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of \n subsequent requests as described above.\n ,</p>"

For details on the various types see: ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.file.FileHandle}\">,FileHandle,</a>,.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n ,<b>,Multi-part File Upload API,</b>,\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n In order to ensure file upload is robust, all files must be uploaded to\n Synapse in 'parts'. This means clients are expected to divide each file into\n 'parts' and upload each part separately. Since Synapse tracks the state of\n all multi-part uploads, upload failure can be recovered simply by uploading\n all parts that Synapse reports as missing.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n ,<i>,Note: For multi-part upload 1 MB is defined as 1024*1024 bytes ,</i>,\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n The first task in multi-part upload is choosing a part size. The minimum part\n size is 5 MB (1024*1024*5) and the maximum part size is 5 GB (1024*1024*1024*5). \n Therefore, any file with a size less than or equal to 5 MB will have a single part and a partSize=5242880. \n The maximum number of parts for a single file 10,000 parts. The following should be used\n to choose a part size:\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n partSize = max(5242880, (fileSize/10000))\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n Once a partSize is chosen, a multi-part upload can be started using the\n following: ,<a href=\"${POST.file.multipart}\">,POST /file/multipart,</a>, which\n will return an ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.file.MultipartUploadStatus}\">,MultipartUploadStatus,</a>,. The client is expected to use\n MultipartUploadStatus to drive the upload. The client will need to upload\n each missing part (parts with '0' in the partsState) as follows:\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n ,<ol>,\n ,<li>,Get a pre-signed URL to upload the part to using: ,<a href=\"${POST.file.multipart.uploadId.presigned.url.batch}\">,POST\n /file/multipart/{uploadId}/presigned/url/batch,</a>,</li>,\n ,<li>,Upload the part to the pre-signed URL using HTTPs PUT,</li>,\n ,<li>,Add the part to the multi-part upload using: ,<a href=\"${PUT.file.multipart.uploadId.add.partNumber}\">,PUT\n /file/multipart/{uploadId}/add/{partNumber},</a>,</li>,\n ,</ol>,\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n Once all parts have been successfully added to the multi-part upload, the\n upload can be completed using: ,<a href=\"${PUT.file.multipart.uploadId.complete}\">,PUT\n /file/multipart/{uploadId}/complete,</a>, to produce a new ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.file.FileHandle}\">,FileHandle,</a>, If\n the upload fails for any reason, the client should start over ( ,<a href=\"${POST.file.multipart}\">,POST /file/multipart,</a>,) and continue by\n uploading any parts that are reported as missing.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n ,<b>,Multi-part File Copy API,</b>,\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n The multipart API supports a robust copy of existing files to other locations (e.g. in case of a data migration)\n without the need to download and re-upload the file. This is currently supported only from and to S3 storage locations that reside in the same region.\n In order to initiate a multipart copy, a ,<a href=\"${POST.file.multipart}\">,POST /file/multipart,</a>, request can be sent\n using as the body of the request a ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.file.MultipartUploadCopyRequest}\">,MultipartUploadCopyRequest,</a>,.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n The part size allows to parallelize the copy in multiple sub-parts, the same limits of the upload applies to the copy (e.g. it is possible to copy \n a file in a single part up to 5 GB). When initiating a copy we recommend to choose the part size as follows:\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n partSize = max(104857600, (fileSize/10000))\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n Once the multipart copy is initiated the process is the same as the multipart upload:\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n ,<ol>,\n ,<li>,\n Get the part copy pre-signed URLs using: ,<a href=\"${POST.file.multipart.uploadId.presigned.url.batch}\">,POST\n /file/multipart/{uploadId}/presigned/url/batch,</a>,\n ,</li>,\n ,<li>,\n For each pre-signed URL perform an HTTP PUT request with no body, the response of the previous endpoint contains a map of headers that are \n signed with the URL, all of the headers MUST be included in the PUT request.\n ,</li>,\n ,<li>,Once the copy request is performed, add the part to the multi-part copy using: ,<a href=\"${PUT.file.multipart.uploadId.add.partNumber}\">,PUT\n /file/multipart/{uploadId}/add/{partNumber},</a>,. \n The value of the partMD5Hex parameter will be MD5 checksum returned in the response of the request sent to the pre-signed URL.\n ,</li>,\n ,<li>,\n Once all parts have been successfully added to the multi-part copy, the\n copy can be completed using: ,<a href=\"${PUT.file.multipart.uploadId.complete}\">,PUT\n /file/multipart/{uploadId}/complete,</a>, to produce a new ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.file.FileHandle}\">,FileHandle,</a>,\n ,</li>,\n ,</ol>,\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n Note about the copy integrity: The resulting file handle will have the same content MD5 of the source file handle, but synapse\n does not try to re-compute or verify this value. Instead, the integrity check is performed by the cloud provider (currently only S3)\n during the copy request for the part (the request sent to the pre-signed URL). Each copy pre-signed URL is signed with a special\n header that makes sure that the source file didn't change during the copy, if this is the case the PUT request to the pre-signed URL\n will fail and a new copy should be re-started.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n ,<b>,Associating FileHandles with Synapse objects,</b>,\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n FileHandles can be associated with various type of objects such as a ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.FileEntity}\">,FileEntity,</a>, and  ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.wiki.WikiPage}\">,WikiPage,</a>,.

For example, when a WikiPage\n is created for an Entity, the Entity becomes the \"owner\" of the WikiPage.\n Access to the WikiPage is always tied to its owner. For example, to GET a\n WikiPage of an Entity, the caller must have read permission on the Entity.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n To navigate the hierarchy of WikiPages associated with an owner use the ,<a href=\"${GET.entity.ownerId.wikiheadertree2}\">,GET\n /entity/{ownerId}/wikiheadertree2,</a>, method. The returned list of ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.v2.wiki.V2WikiHeader}\">,V2WikiHeaders,</a>, can\n be used to construct a full wiki hierarchy tree for that owner.\n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n To view a timeline of changes made to a WikiPage, use the \n ,<a href=\"${GET.entity.ownerId.wiki2.wikiId.wikihistory}\">,GET/entity/{ownerId}\n /wiki2/{wikiId}/wikihistory,</a>, method. The returned list of ,<a href=\"${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.v2.wiki.V2WikiHistorySnapshot}\">,V2WikiHistorySnapshots\n ,</a>, contain information about who modified the WikiPage and when the changes were made. \n ,</p>,\n ,<p>,\n Note: WikiPages can be nested to created a hierarchy of sub-pages. However,\n there can only be one root WikiPage per owner object, and all sub-pages are\n considered to be owned by the same object as the root page.\n ,</p>"
