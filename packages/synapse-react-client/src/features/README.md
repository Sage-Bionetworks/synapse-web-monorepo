# features

The features directory contains React components for individual features or functionalities of the application. Each feature is typically encapsulated in its own subdirectory. The directories are organized to roughly match the design hierarchy of Synapse and Portals applications.

The directory of a particular feature may contain utility hooks and components that are specific to that feature. More generally reusable components that are not specific to a single feature should be placed in the `../components` folder.
