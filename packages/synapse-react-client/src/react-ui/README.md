# synapse-react-client/react-ui

The react-ui directory contains reusable React components and hooks used throughout the Synapse React Client, and possibly other applications.

This package is intended to contain no business logic or data-fetching, and should only implement the Synapse design system and generic utilities, nor should it depend on any package that does.
